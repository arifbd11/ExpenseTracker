Prerequisites:
Jenkins Installation: Ensure that Jenkins is installed and running on your system. If not, refer to the official Jenkins documentation for installation instructions.

Required Plugins: Make sure the necessary Jenkins plugins are installed, including:
Pipeline: For defining the build pipeline.
Git: For source code management.

Build Script: Ensure that the build script is available in your version control system (e.g., Git repository) and accessible to Jenkins.

Required Software: Make sure all required software and dependencies for the project are installed on the Jenkins server.
